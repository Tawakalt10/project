            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I 
                honestly feel i got every penny's worth

            <p> "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard so many people who had an amzing experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it  incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly after.
                The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling -time of my life. Since
                completing the course. I've sucessfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at VR startup"

            <p>Awesome teaching suppoet from TAs who did the bootcamp themeselves.
                Getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was easy.
            </p>
            <p> "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing. The 
                program gave me confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. you will get the personal attention you need from an 
                incredible community of smart and amazing people."

            <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. i've never written a line of code. i needed 
                some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encoyraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                things about the program. The enire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assitance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                it took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have.in fact, i've offten referred to it during interviews
                as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me to land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                muliple offers. 100% recommended!"
